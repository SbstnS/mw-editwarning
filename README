================================================
 MediaWiki Extension: EditWarning
================================================

Author: Thomas David (nemphis@code-geek.de)
Version: 0.4-rc
Date: 2010-09-12
Licence: GNU GPL 2.0 or later

If the user opens a page for editing which is being edited by another user
at the same time this extension displays a warning on the editing page.

Notice: It's not recommended to use this extension if anonymous users
are allowed to edit pages, because it ignores anonymous page edits.

Notice: This is a beta release. While you're encouraged to test it and report
bugs and problems, you should keep in mind that it could mess things around.

===== Installation =====

1.) Move the folder "EditWarning" to the "extensions" folder of your
    MediaWiki installation.

2.) Execute the following SQL statements in your MediaWiki database:

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS editwarning_locks (
  user_id int(10) unsigned NOT NULL,
  user_name varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  article_id int(10) unsigned NOT NULL,
  timestamp int(11) unsigned NOT NULL,
  section int(2) unsigned NOT NULL,
  KEY user_id (user_id),
  KEY article_id (article_id)
);

ALTER TABLE editwarning_locks
  ADD CONSTRAINT editwarning_locks_ibfk_1 FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES user (user_id) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE,
  ADD CONSTRAINT editwarning_locks_ibfk_2 FOREIGN KEY (article_id) REFERENCES page (page_id) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE;

3.) Add this line to your LocalSettings.php:

require_once("$IP/extensions/EditWarning/EditWarning.php");

4.) Open the file includes/EditPage.php of your MediaWiki installation
    and search for the line:

<span class='editHelp'>{$cancel} | {$edithelp}</span>

    Replace that line with:

<span class='editHelp'>{$edithelp}</span>

5.) Optional: The default timeout is set to 10 minutes. If you want to change
              this setting, add this line to your LocalSettings.php
              (Note: The value is the number of minutes):

$EditWarning_Timeout = 5;

Optional: The extension hides everything except the editor area. If you don't
like this behavior, add this line to your LocalSettings.php:

$EditWarning_OnlyEditor = "false";
