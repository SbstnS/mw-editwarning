Version: 0.3.1

Licence: GNU AGPL 3.0 or later

If the user opens a page for editing which is being edited by another user
at the same time this extension displays a warning on the editing page.

Notice: It's not recommend to use this extension if anonymous users
are allowed to edit pages, because it ignores anonymous page edits.

Notice: It's strongly recommened to upgrade to 0.3.1, if you use an older
of this extension.
 
===== Installation =====

1.) Move the folder "EditWarning" to the "extensions" folder of your
    MediaWiki installation.

2.) Execute the following SQL statement in your MediaWiki database:

CREATE TABLE `current_edits` (
  `id` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL auto_increment,
  `page_id` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL,
  `user_id` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL,
  `user_name` varchar(255) character set latin1 collate latin1_bin NOT NULL,
  `timestamp` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY  (`id`)
) ENGINE=MyISAM DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1;

3.) Add this line to your LocalSettings.php:

require_once("$IP/extensions/EditWarning/EditWarning.php");

4.) Open the file includes/EditPage.php of your MediaWiki installation
    and search for the line:

<span class='editHelp'>{$cancel} | {$edithelp}</span>

    Replace that line with:

<span class='editHelp'>{$edithelp}</span>

5.) Optional: The default timeout is set to 10 minutes. If you want to change
              this setting, add this line to your LocalSettings.php
              (Note: The value is the number of minutes):

$EditWarning_Timeout = 5;
