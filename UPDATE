 Update this extension
================================================

This file describes the steps to update from a previous version of this
extension to the current one. You shouldn't perform a update without
making a backup of your data.

==== from 0.3.x ====

Move the folder "EditWarning" to the "extensions" folder of your MediaWiki
installation and overwrite the old files.

Optional: The extension hides everything except the editor area. If you don't
like this behavior, add this line to your LocalSettings.php:

$EditWarning_OnlyEditor = false;

==== from 0.1 beta ====

1.) Execute the following SQL statement in your MediaWiki database:

TRUNCATE TABLE `current_edits`

2.) Move the folder "EditWarning" to the "extensions" folder of your
    MediaWiki installation and overwrite all files.

3.) Open the file includes/EditPage.php of your MediaWiki installation
    and search for the line:

<span class='editHelp'>{$cancel} | {$edithelp}</span>

    Replace that line with:

<span class='editHelp'>{$edithelp}</span>

4.) Optional: The default timeout is set to 10 minutes. If you want to
              change this setting, add this line to your LocalSettings.php
              (Note: The value is the number of minutes):

$EditWarning_Timeout = 5;

Optional: The extension hides everything except the editor area. If you don't
like this behavior, add this line to your LocalSettings.php:

$EditWarning_OnlyEditor = false;
